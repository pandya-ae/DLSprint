    "[Horovod](https://github.com/horovod/horovod) is an open source tool originally [developed by Uber](https://eng.uber.com/horovod/) to support their need for faster deep learning model training across their many engineering teams. It is part of a growing ecosystem of approaches to distributed training, including for example [Distributed TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/deploy/distributed). Uber decided to develop a solution that utilized [MPI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_Passing_Interface) for distributed process communication, and the [NVIDIA Collective Communications Library (NCCL)](https://developer.nvidia.com/nccl) for its highly optimized implementation of reductions across distributed processes and nodes. The resulting Horovod package delivers on its promise to scale deep learning model training across multiple GPUs and multiple nodes, with only minor code modification and intuitive debugging."

We'll be using it later to coordinate the training process. Because the processes are launched in the MPI environment, they can communicate between each other through a standardized API that Horovod handles for us, though we haven't instructed the training script to actually coordinate yet; at present we will just launch N independent copies of the same training script. We can try this out now by running as many processes (ranks) as there are GPUs. Watch the output and see if the training process appears to be coordinated -- does the training actually work? Do all of the processes run on the GPU you expect them to, and does that match the output of `nvidia-smi`?"

    "In the previous two sections we ran with multiple processes, but each process was running completely independently -- this is not data parallel training, it is just multiple processes running serial training at the same time. The key step to make the training data parallel is to average out gradients across all workers, so that all workers are updating with the same gradients and thus moving in the same direction. Horovod implements an operation that averages gradients across workers. Deploying this in your code is very straightforward and just requires wrapping an existing optimizer (`keras.optimizers.Optimizer`) with a Horovod distributed optimizer (`horovod.keras.DistributedOptimizer`)."

This is extremely important for \"defensive I/O\" purposes (so that if a process or node fails, we don't lose all our work), and is also useful for being able to chart the progress of our training run. Let's think about how that works in the multi-process context.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important issue is that there can be a race condition while writing the checkpoint to a file. If every rank finishes the epoch at the same time, they might be writing to the same filename, and this could result in corrupted data. But more to the point, we don't even need to do this: by construction in synchronous data parallel SGD, every rank has the same copy of the weights at all times, so only one worker needs to write the checkpoint. As usual, our convention will be that the root worker (rank 0) handles this.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the same reason, if we are restarting from a checkpoint later on, we don't need every rank to read in the checkpoint -- only one rank needs to do so, and then it can broadcast the data to all the other workers. (In that case, all the workers do still need to instantiate the same model as the one in the checkpoint.) We also often don't want every rank to read in the checkpoint -- at large enough scale, having thousands of processes all read from the same file on disk can be inefficient. You might also be in a situation where only one server node has the data available, so the broadcast is necessary in that case."

[Standard practice](https://arxiv.org/abs/1404.5997) is to scale the learning rate by the same factor that you have scaled the batch size -- that is, by the number of workers present. This can be done so that the training script does not change for single-process runs, since in that case you just multiply by 1.\n",

Hence, learning rates should be scaled at least with sqrt(k) when using *k* times bigger batch sizes in order to preserve the variance of the batch-averaged gradient. In practice we use linear scaling, often out of convenience, although in different circumstances one or the other may be superior in practice."
